How to improve text formatting?
-------------------------------
The plugin uses [SmartyPants v1.6.0](https://github.com/michelf/php-smartypants) by Michel Fortin, which makes your content more typographically pleasing. It's licensed under [BSD license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause). SmartyPants turns straight quotes into [curly quotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quotation_mark), it also converts text into corresponding [punctuation marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation).

Example
-------
Quotes `" "` are converted into English curly quotes `“ ”`.

Dashes `--` and `---` are converted into en dash `–` and em dash `—`.

Three consecutive dots `...` are converted into an ellipsis `…`.
